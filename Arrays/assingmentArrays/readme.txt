-->Searching in an array- Linear
& Binary Search
Q1. Given an array. FInd the number X in the array. If the element is present, return the index of the element,
else print “Element not found in array”. Input the size of array, array from user and the element X from user.
Use Linear Search to find the element.
Example1

Example 2

Q2. Given an array and an integer “target”, return the last occurrence of “target” in the array. If the target is
not present return -1.
Input 1: arr = [1 1 1 2 3 4 4 5 6 6 6 6] , target = 4
Output 1: 6
Input 2: arr = [2 2 2 6 6 18 29 30 30 30] , target = 15
Output 2: -1
Q3. Given a sorted binary array, efficiently count the total number of 1’s in it.
Input 1: arr = [0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1]
Output 1: 6
Input 2: arr = [ 0 0 0 0 0 1 1]
Output 2: 2
Q4. Given a sorted integer array containing duplicates, count occurrences of a given number. If the element
is not found in the array, report that as well.
Input: nums[] = [2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]
target = 5
Output: Target 5 occurs 3 times
Input: nums[] = [2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]
target = 6
Output: Target 6 occurs 2 times
Q5: Given a positive integer num, return true if num is a perfect square or false otherwise.
A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, it is the product of some integer
with itself.
Example 1:
Input: num = 16
Output: true
Explanation: We return true because 4 * 4 = 16 and 4 is an integer.
Example 2:
Input: num = 14
Output: false
Explanation: We return false because 3.742 * 3.742 = 14 and 3.742 is not an integer.


-->DSA(number system)

Problem 1: given a number, print its binary representation. [easy]
Input 1: number = 5
Output 1: 101
Input 2: number = 10
Output 2: 1010
Problem 2: given a number ‘n’, predict whether it is a power of two or not. [medium]
Input 1: n = 15
Output 1: False
Input 2: n = 32
Output 2: True
Q3. Problem 1: Given a number. Using bit manipulation, check whether it is odd or even.
Input 8, Even
3, False
Q4. Given a number, count the number of set bits in that number without using an extra space.
Note : bit ‘1’ is also known as set bit.
Q5. Given an integer array, duplicates are present in it in a way that all duplicates appear an even
number of times except one which appears an odd number of times. Find that odd appearing
element in linear time and without using any extra memory.
For example,
Input : arr[] = [4, 3, 6, 2, 6, 4, 2, 3, 4, 3, 3]
Output : The odd occurring element is 4.

-->Sorting Array

Q1. Write a program to sort an array in descending order using bubble sort.
Input Array {3,5,1,6,0}
Output Array: {6, 5, 3, 1, 0}
Q2. WAP to sort an array in descending order using selection sort
Input Array {3,5,1,6,0}
Output Array: {6, 5, 3, 1, 0}
Q3. WAP to sort an array in decreasing order using insertion sort
Input Array {3,5,1,6,0}
Output Array: {6, 5, 3, 1, 0}
Q4. Find out how many pass would be required to sort the following array in decreasing order
using bubble sort
Input Array {3,5,1,6,0}
Q5. Find out the number of iterations to sort the array in descending order using selection sort.
Input Array {3,5,1,6,0}
